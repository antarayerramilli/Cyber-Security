A lightweight, decentralized, and verifiable cryptographic voting node designed for tamper-evident digital elections and community governance.

## Overview

OpenBallot implements a decentralized ledger tailored specifically for balloting and referendums. Instead of relying on a centralized election database, ballots are cryptographically signed by voters using **Ed25519** public keys, ingested into an unconfirmed transaction pool (**mempool**), and sealed into blocks through **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** Nakamoto-style consensus.

## Features

- **Ed25519 Cryptography**: Fast, secure asymmetric signatures for ballot authenticity.
- **Auditable Ledger**: Chained blocks containing cryptographically signed voter choices.
- **Decentralized Consensus**: Longest-chain conflict resolution across peer nodes.
- **Zero Heavy Dependencies**: Built on top of Python's standard HTTP libraries and `cryptography`.
- **Developer CLI**: Full command-line client for key generation, vote casting, mining, and tally verification.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openballot/openballot.git
cd openballot

# Install dependencies (or run directly in your environment)
pip install cryptography pytest requests
```

### 2. Run the Node Daemon

Start a local OpenBallot node:

```bash
python3 -m openballot.cli serve --port 8000 --difficulty 1
```

Check node health:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

### 3. Generate Voter Keys & Cast a Ballot

Open a new terminal window:

```bash
# 1. Generate keypair for Alice
python3 -m openballot.cli keygen --save alice.json

# 2. Cast a vote on proposal PROP-2026-01
SECRET=$(jq -r '.secret_key' alice.json)
python3 -m openballot.cli vote \
  --key "$SECRET" \
  --proposal "PROP-2026-01" \
  --choice "YES" \
  --node "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# 3. Mine pending ballots into the blockchain
python3 -m openballot.cli mine --node "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# 4. View election results
python3 -m openballot.cli tally --proposal "PROP-2026-01" --node "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
```
